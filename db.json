Greene provides examples in story form to open his chapters, and from there expounds on human nature. However, I now find his modus operandi to be rather stale and formulaic. Bear with me then, as I show how to write a Robert Green book: first, select a number between 10 and 60, second, select a strongly worded title, preferably including 'law' in it, and top it off with colored geometric shapes on the cover. Now to the actual writing: open every chapter with an overly simplified, poorly researched, yet interesting historical anecdote, and then proceed to force it fit into your preconceived lesson for this chapter, with plenty of arm chair psychology and rambling with certainty. Obviously I'm being tongue in cheek, especially as the stories Greene tells are certainly his strong points, but I don't think Greene put in the requisite leg work to make this book anywhere near as good as it should have been, and I find that disappointing.",

One of his biggest points in this chapter is that nothing a parent does (for example, taking their child to museums or reading books to their toddler) matters in the slightest. The only data he uses to draw this conclusion is a collection of test scores. Obviously a high test score does not equal a well-raised, happy child in a healthy family environment. And of course what you do as a parent matters. You can’t totally neglect your child and then claim you’re a perfect parent because of your socioeconomic status. You also cannot determine what makes a good parent based on children’s test scores alone.",
